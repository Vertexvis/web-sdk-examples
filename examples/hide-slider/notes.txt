IDEAS:
- hide parts in reverse order of assembly.  slider 'rolls back' assembly.
- ordered list comes from MPM configs

- The lower fidelity representation of the model is the view cube, which is a lightweight 3D mesh of the model, textured with rendered images.
	- View cube represents bounding box of the scene, with sub controls to change 'hide box'
	- for VR, we just need to make the view cube better over time? full screen
- This hide slider is basically like cross sectioning, only 'live'
- Should add ability to cross section a subset of parts
	- maybe cross sectioning in platform is applied per scene item, or based on a query
	- could be 'all' or a subset of scene items
- Snapshots are just serialized/persisted scene views.
- When passing in an array of operations to the web sdk, have it ignore any entries that are null or undefined
	- able to use ternary operators inline


BUGS:
- If you try to send more than 200 operations in a web sdk call, it should error on the client??  Right now user does not get any meaningful error response.
